//Java collection framework is a set of classes and  interfaces that implement that commonly reusable collection dataStrutures.it provides standardised ways to organise and manipulate group of objects.
//introduced in jdk 1.2 update before that java provided ds like arrays and vectors.but they lacked a consistent API and  interoperdability.
//Java interface is a blue print for a class it provides  set of methods that a class can impliment.but it doen't say how those methods should work.
//Interfaces:-- 
	//List:- list is a ordered collection and sequence of elements where duplicates are allowed.elements in the list are indexed which means u can access them by their position of a list.
		//ArrayList,linkedList
	//Set:- A set is  a collection of unordered element in which duplicates are not allowed.
		//HashSet,LinkedHashSet,treeset
	//Map:- A map stores data in key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and it maps to a specific value.
		//HashMap,TreeMap,linkedHashMap--efficient for member checking
	//Queue:- Queue is a collection of elements which follows fifo.
		//	PriorityQueue --> order processing, processing strategy, limited access.
