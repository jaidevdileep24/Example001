//Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language used to create a wide range of software, from desktop applications to web and mobile apps
//Advantages of Java:- PlatformIndependance(os,mac,lunix),WORA(laptop,mobile,tab),portability,secure and reliable,used everywhere,high-level language.
//different  type of main methods
//public static void main(String args[]) {}
//public static void main(Sting[] args) {}
//public static void main(Sting... jai) {}
//static public void main(Sting args) {}

//What is Programming:- Programming is the process of telling a computer what to do using a specific language. it involves writing instructions in a certain programming language like java or python to perform tasks.
//why do we learn Programming:---> to solve problems,To automate tasks,To create.
//What is a Program:---> A program is a set of instructions written in programming language that tells to the computer how to do a specific task.it involves step by step process to solve a specific task.
//Steps to run a Java Programming:-
//1. compile the program:--> converts java code into machine understandable code --> javac filename.java
//2. run the program --> java.filename


//Compilation:- the process where javaCompiler converts human understandable java code .java into machine understandable code byteCode(.class) which is understood by jvm.
//in compilation time javaC checks for 
//syntax errors,type errors,variable scope and decelerations,method and class definition errors,Access modifiers and visibility errors, checked exceptions

//run/Execution:---> The jvm interrupts the compiled  byteCode and runs the program on our machine.


//convert java code into byte code(with the help of javac command) --->Loading the class(.class file loaded into the memory using java class loader) ---> byteCode verifier --> finding the main method and starts the executing.---> JIT compiler(internally jvm uses JIT  compiler to speed up the things)
//Jvm responsibilities:- Loads class file using class loader, verifies the byte code using bytecodeverifier,executes the java bytecode.
//java is a versatile and powerful

//Architecture Of java
//Java Development kit(JDK):-The java development kit(JDK) is a set of tools for developing java appilications.JDK is like out javaTool kit.it contains everything u need to write,debug java programs.
	//components of JDK:- javacompiler,Java debugger,

//Java Virtuval envoriment(JRE):- the jre is what allows our complied code into run.
 //includes libraries,it also contains jvm.

//JavaVirtuval Machine(JVM);-it is responsible to execute our bytecode to execute.
	//Loading,verifying,executing
public class JavaIntro {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
